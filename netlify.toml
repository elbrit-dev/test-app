  # Reduce environment variable size for Lambda functions

  # The solution is to only set server-side env vars in Netlify UI (see NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP.md)

  # Build-time variables (available during build, embedded in bundle)
  # NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are automatically available during build
  # and get embedded in the JavaScript bundle, so they don't need to be
  # passed to Lambda functions at runtime.
